    	<h1>How are designer Babies made and What are the pros and cons?</h1>

      <img src="coup.jpg"  class="figure-img img-fluid text-center">

    	<p>If you had the ability to tinker with the genetics of your baby, would you?<br/>
		What if you could prevent a hereditary disease? Might it become ‘unethical’ to NOT correct genetic errors?<br/>
		Since we discovered CRISPR/Cas9, a tool used to “edit” the human genome with incredible precision, these questions are no longer theoretical and philosophical — they are very, very real.<br/>
		Just three years after its initial development, CRISPR technology is already widely used by biologists as a kind of search-and-replace tool to alter DNA, even down to the level of a single letter.
		By editing the DNA of these cells or the embryo itself (germline engineering), it could be possible to correct disease genes and pass those genetic fixes on to future generations.
		Such a technology could be used to rid families of scourges like cystic fibrosis and muscular dystrophy.

		<h3>What is a Designer Baby?</h3>

		<p>A designer baby is a baby that is created through a genetic screening or genetic modification process. Genetic modification is a process, in which a certain technology or a set of technologies help modify the genetic makeup of cells. It also involves transferring the genes to create opportunities for the genetic makeup.</p>


		<h3>Facts About Designer Babies:</h3>

		<p>Whether you are planning to have a designer baby or you simply want to know more about it, here are a few facts about designer babies that you should know:
			<ul>
				<li>Most parents who want to opt for the option of a designer baby look for various illnesses that could be prevented in the baby. The most common diseases that the parents look for are cancer, blindness, mental illness, and more.</li>
				<li>1 out of 10 people who opt for having a designer baby feel that they can improve their baby’s overall intelligence and his height.</li>
				<li>3 out of 10 people who opt for having a designer baby feel that they can make their babies immortal.</li>
				<li>32 percent people who opt for having a designer baby want to do so in the hope that they can prevent various health issues in their babies.</li>
				<li>Countries such as India, China, and the UK, do not support the process of designer babies and have, in fact, made it an illegal.</li>
				<li>The technology that helps to create designer babies is not one hundred percent safe. At the moment, it is still in its experimental stage and there is much to be developed and tested.</li>
				<li>If the process of creating a designer baby is not done properly, it could result in an accidental termination of the baby.</li>
				<li>In many cases, parents opt for having a designer baby only to create superficial benefits for the baby. Many parents opt for the process only to get a certain type of look, such as having a baby with blonde hair or blue eyes.</li>
				<li>There is a debate that says that creating designer babies can lead to a gap in society, where babies who are born in a regular way will have a marked difference compared to babies who are born as part of the designer baby series. Such babies who are born as designer babies may look better, think better or even have lesser chances of falling sick.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>


      <p> <h4>Traits Common To Designer Babies</h4>

      If you are planning on having a designer baby, here are some of the features that you could modify:
      <ul>
      <li>Baby’s gender</li>
      <li>Baby’s outward look</li>
      <li>Protect baby against diseases</li>
      <li>Alter baby’s total personality</li>
      <li>Improvement in baby’s level of intelligence</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>Benefits Of Designer Babies
Although some of the most apparent benefits of designer babies are superficial (6 feet tall, blue-eyes, blonde hair etc.), the technology does have some remarkable merits:
<ol>
<li><b>Longer life:</b> When you genetically modify a baby, one of the first things you do is take away the defective genes. This means that designer babies would theoretically live a healthier life with fewer chances of illness. According to studies, this can add up to 30 years to a child’s life expectancy</li>
<li><b>No genetic disorders:</b> There are a number of illness people catch due to genetic disorders. These include Alzheimer’s disease, muscular atrophy, Down syndrome etc. Genetic modification reduces the chances of your child being impacted by many such genetic problems</li>
<li><b>No hereditary disorders:</b> Often, many health conditions such as diabetes, cancer, obesity, heart ailments and anemia are inherited from either of the parents’ families. Knowing the family history in advance will help genetic scientists to remove the problematic genes in question from the embryo</li>
<li><b>Positive life for baby:</b> It is hoped that designer babies will lead generally a better life as parents and scientists have called the shots in terms of the child’s health, looks and intelligence</li>
</ol>

</p>


<p><h4>Problems Associated With Designer Babies</h4>

As always, where there are pros, there are cons. There are many questions raised with respect to designer babies:<br><br>
 <ol>
<li><b>Is it safe?</b> <br> This is still a new and evolving field. The whole process can be called, at best, experimental. While the benefits look very attractive, the procedure is risky and not 100% safe. Even a small mistake during the genetic alteration can lead to problems for the baby, and even miscarriage. It can also give rise to new illness we are not even aware of.</li>
<li><b>Is it sustainable?</b><br> The impact of designer babies passing on the altered genes is not yet researched or understood.</li>
<li><b>Is it ethical?</b><br> There are multiple ethical and moral questions associated with creating genetic babies. Many activists believe that modifying the genes of a child is playing God or nature. If it becomes popular, then society will soon be divided into genetically modified “near perfect” people and normal people, creating a huge gap and class difference. Many consider this unfair.</li>
<li><b>Does your baby want it?,</b><br> You are calling shots here. You are altering your baby’s life without his or her approval</li><br>
Not everyone can afford designer babies. Only rich couples can think of putting their money and time in altering and getting a baby of their choice. Before you think of having a designer baby, make sure you have a good and hearty discussion with your doctor to understand all the pros and cons.
</ol>
