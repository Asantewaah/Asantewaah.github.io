  <h1 class="text-center">Health And Nutrition</h1>

  <img src="eating.jpg"  class="figure-img img-fluid text-center">


  <p>A healthy diet is an important part of a healthy lifestyle at any time, but especially vital if you’re pregnant or planning a pregnancy. Healthy eating keeps you feeling good and gives your baby the essential nutrients they need in utero.
  Overall, aim for a balanced diet, with an appropriate blend of all the five food groups:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>vegetables and legumes</li>
      <li>breads and cereals</li>
      <li>milk, yoghurt and cheese</li>
      <li>meat, poultry, fish and alternatives</li>
      <li>fruit.</li>
  </ul>

    <p>Foods containing protein help the baby grow. Meat, fish, chicken, eggs, milk, cheeses, nuts, beans and peas are all good sources of protein.
    Aim to drink 6-8 glasses of water every day – most town water contains fluoride, which helps your growing baby’s teeth develop strong enamel. Some water supplies say from a tank do not have fluoride.
    You will probably find that you are more hungry than usual, but you don’t need to ‘eat for two’ – even if you are expecting twins or triplets.
    Have a healthy breakfast every day because this can help you to avoid snacking on foods that are high in fat and sugar.
    Eating healthily often means just changing the amounts of different foods you eat so that your diet is varied, rather than cutting out all your favourites.
    You will need to be careful with your diet if you develop gestational diabetes – your doctor or midwife will advise you.</p>





      <h4>Fruit and vegetables</h4>
      <img src="vege.jpg"  class="figure-img img-fluid text-center">

        <p>Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables because these provide vitamins and minerals, as well as fibre, which helps digestion and prevents constipation. Eat a variety of fruit and vegetables a day – these can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced. Always wash them carefully. Cook vegetables lightly in a little water, or eat them raw but well washed, to get the benefit of the nutrients they contain.</p>
    <h6>Starchy foods (carbohydrates)</h6>
    <p>Starchy foods are an important source of vitamins and fibre, and are satisfying without containing too many calories. They include bread, potatoes, breakfast cereals, rice, pasta, noodles, maize, millet, oats, sweet potatoes, yams and cornmeal. These foods should be the main part of every meal. Eat wholemeal instead of processed (white) varieties when you can.</p>
    <h6>Protein</h6>
    <p>Sources of protein include meat (but avoid liver), fish (however, avoid fish that is high in mercury such as shark/flake, marlin or broadbill/ swordfish), poultry, eggs, beans, pulses and nuts. Eat some protein every day. Choose lean meat, remove the skin from poultry, and cook it using only a little fat. Make sure eggs, poultry, pork, burgers and sausages are cooked all the way through. Check that there is no pink meat, and that juices have no pink or red in them. Try to eat 2 portions of fish a week, one of which should be oily fish such as sardines or mackerel.</p>
    <h6>Dairy</h6>
    <p>Dairy foods such as milk, cheese, and yoghurt are important because they contain calcium and other nutrients that your baby needs. Choose reduced fat varieties wherever possible. There are some cheeses that should be avoided - see Foods to avoid.</p>
    <h6>Alcohol</h6>
    <p>There is no safe level of alcohol that you can have during your pregnancy. Whether you are planning a pregnancy, already pregnant or breastfeeding, not drinking is the safest option as alcohol can harm your unborn baby.</p>

    <h7>Limit foods that are high in sugar, fat and salt</h7>
    <p>These foods includes all spreading fats (such as butter), oils, salad dressings, cream, chocolate, crisps, biscuits, pastries, ice-cream, cake, puddings and fizzy drinks. You should eat only a small amount of these foods. Sugar contains calories without providing any other nutrients, and can contribute to weight gain, obesity and tooth decay. Fat is very high in calories, and eating more fatty foods is likely to make you put on weight. Having too much saturated fat can increase the amount of cholesterol in the blood, which increases the chance of developing heart disease. Try to cut down on saturated fat, and have foods rich in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat instead, such as oils, spreads, nut butters/pastes and avocado.<br>
    Limit foods containing added salt and don’t add salt in cooking or at the table.</p>

    <p><b>Healthy snacks:</b> <br/>
    If you get hungry between meals, don’t eat snacks that are high in fat and/or sugar, such as sweets, biscuits, crisps or chocolate. Instead, choose from the following nutritious snacks:
    sandwiches or pitta bread filled with grated cheese, grilled chicken, mashed tuna, salmon or sardines and salad
    salad vegetables, such as carrot, celery or cucumber
    low-fat yoghurt hummus with bread or vegetable sticks
    ready-to-eat apricots, figs or prunes
    vegetable and bean soups
    unsweetened breakfast cereals, or porridge, with milk
    milky drinks or unsweetened fruit juices
    fresh fruit
    baked beans on toast or a baked potato.<br/><br/>

    <b>Preparing food safely:</b><br/>
    Wash fruit, vegetables and salads to remove all traces of soil, which may contain toxoplasma, a parasite that can cause toxoplasmosis - toxoplasmosis can harm your unborn baby.
    Wash all surfaces and utensils, and your hands, after preparing raw meat - this will help to avoid toxoplasmosis.
    Make sure that raw foods are stored separately from ready-to-eat foods, otherwise there’s a risk of contamination - this is to avoid other types of food poisoning from meat (such as salmonella, campylobacter and E. Coli).
    Use a separate chopping board for raw meats.
    Heat ready meals until they’re piping hot all the way through - this is especially important for meals containing poultry.
    You also need to make sure that some foods, such as eggs and sausages, are cooked very thoroughly.
    Learn more about safe food preparation.

      <h3>Listeria</h3>

          <h4>What is listeria?</h4>
      <p>Listeria is a bacterium (Listeria monocytogenes) that is common in the environment, and is carried by many farm animals and pets. You can be infected by listeria if you eat contaminated food. Some foods are riskier than others – the riskiest are those eaten raw or inadequately cooked.
      Listeriosis the name of the infection caused by listeria. It is rare, but potentially serious, especially for a fetus or newborn. Each year in Australia, about 150 people are hospitalised due to listeriosis, and a small number die.<br/><br/>

      <b>Listeriosis symptoms</b><br/>
      Many people exposed to listeria remain healthy. Some have no symptoms, while others have vomiting and diarrhoea, which is normally resolved without medical treatment.
      But listeria can pass from the gut to other parts of the body such as the placenta and the brain. This type of listeria infection has a long incubation period (meaning it can take weeks or months after exposure for any symptoms to show).
      Symptoms can be mild, including:
      <ul>
          <li>mild fever</li>
          <li>muscle aches and joint pain</li>
          <li>headache</li>
          <li>diarrhoea</li>
          <li>nausea</li>
          <li>cough or cold</li>

        </ul><br><br>
          In rare cases, listeria can cause serious and life-threatening blood poisoning (septicaemia), meningitis (inflammation around the brain) or encephalitis (infection of the brain). Symptoms of these serious conditions include:<br/><br/>

          <ul>
          <li>high fever</li>
          <li>stiff neck</li>
          <li>headache</li>
          <li>sleepiness and confusion</li>
          <li>seizures</li>
        </ul> <br><br> 
        <b>Listeriosis in pregnancy and newborn babies</b> 
        While listeriosis can affect anyone, it’s particularly worrying for pregnant women because it can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth.
        Newborn babies infected with listeria from their mother can become seriously ill with meningitis, blood poisoning or other infections. There are no records of women passing listeria to their babies through breastfeeding, however. <br><br>
        <b>Listeria diagnosis </b>
        You should see your doctor if you think you might have listeriosis. For example, if you:
        have eaten food subject to a recall for listeria contamination, or
        are experiencing any symptoms of listeriosis
        Your doctor will discuss the foods you’ve eaten and probably take a sample of blood. Listeriosis is confirmed if laboratory tests find listeria growing in the sample.<br><br>
        <b>Listeriosis treatment</b>
        If you do develop listeriosis, you’ll be treated with antibiotics. Prompt treatment can stop the infection from passing to your unborn baby.<br><br>
        <b>Listeriosis prevention</b>
        The best way to avoid listeria infection is to avoid high-risk foods, and to follow hygienic food handling techniques.
        Foods at high risk of carrying listeria include:
            <ul>
            <li>foods at ready-to-eat salad bars, sandwich bars and delicatessens</li>
            <li>ready-to-eat meals</li>
            <li>soft and semi-soft cheeses</li>
            <li>unwashed raw vegetables</li>
            <li>soft-serve ice cream</li>
            <li>raw shellfish and seafood</li>
            <li>unpasteurised dairy products</li>
            <li>cold cured or prepared meats</li>
          </ul>
        </p>


        <h4>Exercise During Pregnancy</h4>
        <img src="pose.jpg"  class="figure-img img-fluid text-center">

        <p>Maintaining a regular exercise routine throughout your pregnancy can help you stay healthy and feel your best. Regular exercise during pregnancy can improve your posture and decrease some common discomforts such as backaches and fatigue. There is evidence that physical activity may prevent gestational diabetes (diabetes that develops during pregnancy), relieve stress, and build more stamina needed for labor and delivery.<br><br>
        If you were physically active before your pregnancy, you should be able to continue your activity in moderation. Don't try to exercise at your former level; instead, do what's most comfortable for you now. Low impact aerobics are encouraged versus high impact.<br>
        The pregnant competitive athlete should be closely followed by an obstetrician.
        If you have never exercised regularly before, you can safely begin an exercise program during pregnancy after consulting with your health care provider, but do not try a new, strenuous activity. Walking is considered safe to initiate when pregnant.</p>

        <h5>Who Should Not Exercise During Pregnancy?</h5>
        If you have a medical problem, such as asthma, heart disease, or diabetes, exercise may not be advisable. Exercise may also be harmful if you have a pregnancy-related condition such as:

            <ul>
              <li>Bleeding or spotting</li>
              <li>Low placenta</li>
              <li>Threatened or recurrent miscarriage</li>
              <li>Previous premature births or history of early labor</li>
              <li>Weak cervix</li>
            </ul>
            Talk with your health care provider before beginning an exercise program. Your health care provider can also give you personal exercise guidelines, based on your medical history
            

            <h5>What Exercises Are Safe During Pregnancy?</h5>
          <p>Most exercises are safe to perform during pregnancy, as long as you exercise with caution and do not overdo it.
          The safest and most productive activities are swimming, brisk walking, indoor stationary cycling, step or elliptical machines, and low-impact aerobics (taught by a certified aerobics instructor). These activities carry little risk of injury, benefit your entire body, and can be continued until birth.<br><br>
          Tennis and racquetball are generally safe activities, but changes in balance during pregnancy may affect rapid movements. Other activities such as jogging can be done in moderation, especially if you were doing them before your pregnancy. You may want to choose exercises or activities that do not require great balance or coordination, especially later in pregnancy.
          To learn strength and toning exercises that are safe to do during pregnancy.</p>


          <h5>What Exercises Should Be Avoided During Pregnancy?</h5>
          There are certain exercises and activities that can be harmful if performed during pregnancy. They include:
          <ul>
              <li>Holding your breath during any activity.</li>
              <li>Activities where falling is likely (such as skiing and horseback riding).
              <li>Contact sports such as softball, football, basketball, and volleyball.</li>
              <li>Any exercise that may cause even mild abdominal trauma such as activities that include jarring motions or rapid changes in direction.</li>
              <li>Activities that require extensive jumping, hopping, skipping, bouncing, or running.</li>
              <li>Deep knee bends, full sit-ups, double leg raises, and straight-leg toe touches.</li>
              <li>Bouncing while stretching.</li>
              <li>Waist-twisting movements while standing.</li>
              <li>Heavy exercise spurts followed by long periods of no activity.</li>
              <li>Exercise in hot, humid weather.</li>

          </ul>

          <h5>What Should a Pregnancy Exercise Program Consist Of?</h5>
          For total fitness, a pregnancy exercise program should strengthen and condition your muscles.<br>
          Always begin by warming up for five minutes and stretching for five minutes. Include at least fifteen minutes of cardiovascular activity. Measure your heart rate at times of peak activity. Follow aerobic activity with five to ten minutes of gradually slower exercise that ends with gentle stretching.<br><br>
          Here are some basic exercise guidelines for pregnant women:<br>
          <ul>
              <li>Wear loose fitting, comfortable clothes as well as a good support bra.</li>
              <li>Choose shoes that are designed for the type of exercise you do. Proper shoes are your best protection against injury.</li>
              <li>Exercise on a flat, level surface to prevent injury.</li>
              <li>Consume enough calories to meet the needs of your pregnancy (300 more calories per day than before you were pregnant) as well as your exercise program.</li>
              <li>Finish eating at least one hour before exercising.</li>
              <li>Drink water before, during, and after your workout.</li>
              <li>After doing floor exercises, get up slowly and gradually to prevent dizziness.</li>
              <li>Never exercise to the point of exhaustion. If you cannot talk normally while exercising, you are probably over-exerting yourself and should slow down your activity.</li>
          </ul>

          <h5>What Pregnancy Changes May Affect Exercise?</h5>
          Physical changes during pregnancy create extra demands on your body. Keeping in mind the changes listed below, remember that you need to listen to your body and adjust your activities or exercise routine as necessary.<br><br>
          Your developing baby and other internal changes require more oxygen and energy.
          Hormones produced during pregnancy cause the ligaments that support your joints to stretch, increasing the risk of injury.
          The extra weight and the uneven distribution of your weight shift your center of gravity. The extra weight also puts stress on joints and muscles in the lower back and pelvic area and makes it easier for you to lose your balance.
