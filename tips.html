      <h1>Great Tips to Increase Chances of getting pregnant</h1>

      <img src="nice.jpg"  class="figure-img img-fluid text-center">


    <ol>
      <li><h4>Do get a preconception checkup.</h4></li>
      <p>Before you officially start trying, get a checkup. Ask your doctor about prenatal vitamins that have folic acid , which helps protect against some birth defects, such as spina bifida . Folic acid works during the early stages of pregnancy, so that's why it's important to make sure you're getting enough folic acid even before you get pregnant.<br>
      "Do this the cycle before you start trying," says Paula Hillard, MD, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University. "If you have any underlying medical problems, they need to be under control before you can safely become pregnant."</p>



      <li><h4>Record menstrual cycle frequencyh4></li>
        <p>A woman who wants to have a baby should monitor whether the first days of her periods tend to come the same number of days apart every month, which is considered being regular. Conversely, her periods may be irregular, meaning her cycle lengths vary from month to month. By tracking this information on a calendar, a woman can better predict when she might be ovulating, the time when her ovaries will release an egg every month.<br>
        A woman's egg is fertile for only 12 to 24 hours after its release, according to the March of Dimes. However, a man's sperm can survive in a woman's body for about 6 days, notes Planned Parenthood. </p>

      <li><h4>Don't overdo it.</h4></li>
      <p>Having sex every day even during ovulation will not necessarily increase your chances of getting pregnant. "In general, every other night around the time of ovulation helps increase your chance of getting pregnant," Goldfarb says. Sperm can live up to 72 hours after intercourse. The best suggestion is to have sex regularly -- when you're ovulating, and when you're not.<br>
      Speaking of sperm, "wearing tight-fitting clothing can negatively affect sperm count," Piscitelli says. So too can spending time in hot tub or Jacuzzi. Your man's cell phone habits may also also need some work. A study in the journal Fertility and Sterility showed that men who used a hands-free device with a cell phone and kept their phone close to their testicles had poorer sperm quality.<br>
      He might want to pass on the edamame and other soy foods for a while, too. Men who eat a lot of soy foods may have a lower sperm concentration than men who don't eat soy foods, according to a study published online in Human Reproduction.</p>

      <li><h4>Monitor ovulation</h4></li>
      <p>Women with regular cycles generally ovulate two weeks before the arrival of their periods, Pavone said. It's harder to predict ovulation in women with irregular cycles, but it usually occurs 12 to 16 days before the start of her next period.
      There are several methods women can use to help determine their most fertile days each month.<br>
      Home ovulation-prediction kits can take some of the guesswork out of figuring out when a woman is ovulating. They're good to use for this purpose, Pavone said, but she suggested reading the instructions before using the products, since each kit can be a little different. <br>
      Sold at drug stores, the kits test urine for lutenizing hormone, a substance whose levels increase each month during ovulation and cause the ovaries to release an egg. The three days right after a positive test result are the best time for couples to have sex to increase their odds of becoming pregnant, reports the American Pregnancy Association.<br>
      Other clues to ovulation include the basal body temperature method, in which a woman takes her temperature before she gets out of bed every day and charts this on a graph for at least three menstrual cycles. After a woman ovulates, her basal body temperature typically increases less than half a degree Fahrenheit (0.3 degrees Celsius). A woman is most fertile during the two to three days before this slight rise in body temperature, reports the Mayo Clinic.<br>
      A second method is tracking cervical mucus, which involves a woman regularly checking both the amount and appearance of mucus in her vagina. A study published in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that women who checked their cervical mucus consistently were 2.3 times more likely to get pregnant over a six-month period.<br>
      Just before ovulation when a woman is most fertile, the amount of mucus increases and it also becomes thinner, clearer, and more slippery, said the March of Dimes. When cervical mucus becomes more slippery, it can help sperm make its way to the egg. </p>


      <li><h4>Strive for a healthy body weighth4></li>
      <p>Being too heavy can reduce a woman's odds of conceiving, but being too thin can make it even harder to have a baby. <br>
        Research has shown that a woman who is overweight (her body mass index, or BMI, is greater than 35) can take twice as long to become pregnant than a woman whose BMI is considered normal, Pavone said. A woman who is underweight (her BMI is less than 19) might take four times as long to conceive, she said. <br>
        Having too much body fat produces excess estrogen, which can interfere with ovulation. Losing 5 to 10 percent of body weight before a woman starts trying to get pregnant could improve her fertility, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
        A study done in 2017 found that couples in which both partners are obese may take from 55 to 59 percent longer to become pregnant, compared with couples who are not obese. <br>
        Women who are too thin might not be getting regular periods or could stop ovulating.</p>

      <li><h4>Eat healthy foods</h4></li>
      <p>Although there may not be a specific fertility-promoting diet, eating a variety of healthy foods can help prepare a woman's body for pregnancy by giving her adequate stores of critical nutrients such as calcium, protein and iron. This means eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, lean protein, whole grains, dairy and healthy sources of fat.<br>
      Besides taking a supplement containing folic acid, a woman can also obtain this B vitamin from foods such as dark green leafy vegetables, broccoli, fortified breads and cereals, beans, citrus fruits and orange juice.<br>
      When trying to get pregnant, eat lower amounts of high-mercury fish, such as swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish. And limit albacore (white) tuna to 6-ounces per week to reduce exposure to this toxic metal, the Food and Drug Administration recommends.<br>
      Also, go easy on caffeine: Consuming more than 500 milligrams of caffeine a day has been linked with a decrease in fertility in women. Having 1 to 2 cups of coffee, or less than 250 mg of caffeine, per day before becoming pregnant appears to have no impact on the likelihood of conception, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. </p>

      <li><h4>Kick the smoking habith4></li>
        <p>Smoking can lead to fertility problems in both women and men. Chemicals found in cigarette smoke, such as nicotine and carbon monoxide, speed up the loss rate of awoman's eggs, said the American Society for Reproductive Medicine.
        Smoking ages a woman's ovaries and depletes her supply of eggs prematurely, according to the Mayo Clinic.
        It's also a good idea for women to stay away from secondhand smoke, which may affect their chances of becoming pregnant. Marijuana and other recreational drug use should also be avoided while trying to conceive.</p>
