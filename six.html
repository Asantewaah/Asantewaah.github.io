      <p>A postpartum (or postnatal) period begins immediately after the birth of a child as the mother's body, including hormone levels and uterus size, returns to a non-pregnant state. The terms puerperium or puerperal period, or immediate postpartum period are commonly used to refer to the first 6 weeks following childbirth. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes the postnatal period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies; most maternal and/or newborn deaths occur during the postnatal period.In scientific literature, the term is commonly abbreviated to Px, where x is a number; for example, "day P5" should be read as "the fifth day after birth". This is not to be confused with the medical nomenclature that uses G P to stand for number and outcomes of pregnancy (gravidity and parity).</p>

      <p>A woman giving birth in a hospital may leave as soon as she is medically stable, which can be as early as a few hours postpartum, though the average for a vaginal birth is one to two days. The average caesarean section postnatal stay is three to four days.During this time, the mother is monitored for bleeding, bowel and bladder function, and baby care. The infant's health is also monitored.[5] Early postnatal hospital discharge is typically defined as discharge of the mother and newborn from the hospital within 48 hours of birth.</p>

      <p>The postpartum period can be divided into three distinct stages; the initial or acute phase, 6-12 hours after childbirth; subacute postpartum period, which lasts 2-6 weeks, and the delayed postpartum period, which can last up to 6 months.In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem.Long term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31% of women.</p>


      <h3>Preparing For Birth</h3>
      <div>
      <img src="pre.jpg" class="figure-img img-fluid" style="float: left; clear: both; padding-right: 20px;">
      <p>As we grow these little tiny beings in our bodies, we are always thinking about the big day when he/she will come out. "How will I be able to handle the pain?" we ask ourselves. "What can I do to prepare?" The truth of the matter is, there is a lot of pain, suffering and "uncomfortableness" around pregnancy, and leading up to the big day. If we condition ourselves to be "comfortable" with what we go through during pregnancy, we will have a solid foundation going into birth.</p>

      <p>It often feels like life is moving faster and faster all the time, but in the delivery room, things are actually slowing down. A National Institutes of Health study found that childbirth for first-time moms now takes 2.6 hours longer than it did 50 years ago. To make that extra time in the delivery room less painful and more joyful, it helps to know how to make the hard work of having a baby more manageable. Starting today, here are 10 things you can do to make your birth experience that much easier. </p>

      <p>Here are few ways you can prepare yourself and your body for a smooth labor and easier birth.

      </div><br/><br/>

        <ol>
          <li><h4>Educate Yourself</h4></li>
            <p>There's a lot of fear around the unknown of what happens to our bodies during pregnancy and labor. The more fear that we have, the more we become anxious and the more stress hormones are released, thus making labor, in itself, more painful.<br/>
            You can take a childbirth course and enroll as early as possible: Not only do classes fill up fast, but some, such as The Bradley Method courses, run 12 weeks, which means you need to start them in your second trimester.
            As you ease your mind--empowering it with information about what to expect throughout pregnancy and labor--the intensity of pain lessens.</p>

          <li><h4>GIve Yourself Regular Exercise</h4></li>
          <p>Through consistent activity, you allow your body to be conditioned, to become stronger, and to be able to withstand added stress on your joints and muscles. As baby grows within our bodies, our load increases. Our bodies become more used to the "uncomfortableness" of pregnancy and labor.<br/>
          Upright positions, such as standing, walking, kneeling, slow dancing, sitting and squatting, allow gravity to help move the baby down and out. "Sometimes, getting the baby into the pelvis is like fitting a key into a lock," Hartley says. "You need to do a little jiggling. Rocking back and forth on your hands and knees may help to get the baby into position."
          Walking is one of the best activities to do when you are pregnant. It teaches you patience and induces a state of relaxation.</p>

          <li><h4>Get IntoPregnancy Yoga</h4></li>
          <p>In a pregnancy yoga practice, there's a lot of emphasis on breathing, especially through the difficult poses. Through working with our breath, we are able to relax more in uncomfortable moments. Our breath will allow us to remain present and ground us during these times, as well as give us a break in between tough times.<br/>

          "The most important thing women learn through yoga is how to focus," says Carmela Cattuti, L.P.N., a Boston-based Kripalu certified instructor specializing in prenatal yoga certification training. "It also strengthens the entire body, increases flexibility and gives you stamina. But what is possibly even more helpful is that it helps your mind relax." This, in turn, leaves your body free to go about the business of birthing.</p>

          <li><h4>Harness Your Mental Strengths</h4></li>
          <p>Some childbirth educators believe graphic images, catastrophic tales and words of discouragement ("You'll never be able to get that monster out without a C-section!") can affect your subconscious and create a mental block during labor.
          At best, negative thoughts make labor stressful; at worst, they'll actually intensify pain. Change the channel on the TV, tune out or walk away when the subject matter makes you uncomfortable; also, shield yourself from scary labor Facebook threads by logging off.
          Trust in the whole process of pregnancy and labor. Visualize that each contraction is a wave that slowly peaks in intensity, then comes down.
          Having this sense of courage, as you face a contraction, knowing that it will pass, will decrease the anxiety and stress around it. Trust that this too shall pass. In between each contraction, focus on the breath, to allow yourself to rest and become present to this time.</p>

          <li><h4>Call in Your Support System</h4></li>
          <p> Having a stable, peaceful support team is very helpful during childbirth. Don't hesitate to stand up for yourself (or have your partner do so) and tactfully ask a non-peaceful person to leave the room. Hiring a doula is another great way to help support you and your partner during this time.
          A doula is trained in the birth process and in how to help alleviate extra stress of the unknown. Every doula is different in their gifts that they bring to a birth. An increase in peacefulness during the birth process equals a decrease in pain.</p>

          <li><h4>Be Present</h4></li>
          <p>Whatever "uncomfortable" situation you are in, breathe it fully in. There is no running, no escaping, just being with it. If it is a contraction, let it wash over you, like a wave, then soften and surrender into it, as if you were a jellyfish. Allow it to pass through you. It is our very breath that will allow us to be present with it all.</p>

          <li><h4>Have a trick up your sleeve</h4></li>
          <p>Learn several effective techniques to manage pain during childbirth, such as self-hypnosis, position changes, heat pack application and different breathing methods. "If you don't know what your options are, you don't have any," says Tracy Hartley, a certified doula and owner of B*E*S*T Doula Service in Los Angeles.</p>

          <li><h4>Stay true to yourself</h4></li>
          <p>Labor transforms you, but it won't make you suddenly love lime Jell-O, New Age music or the sight of your in-laws as you breathe through a contraction. People may push all kinds of suggestions on you during labor; listen but don't feel you have to go along with them.<br>It's your body, your baby and your labor, so stick to your guns. Consider it practice for when your baby is a teenager.</p>
