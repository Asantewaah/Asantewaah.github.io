    	<h1>Sex Positions to help you get pregnant</h1>

      <img src="position.jpg"  class="figure-img img-fluid text-center">


      <p>Well,you are trying to have a baby? Have you thought this through? Bringing a child into the world might not be very easy. But if you are sure that the time is right, well it is time to get down to business.
      It takes two to tango, and it takes two to make a baby! For some people, an accidental roll in the hay can lead to pregnancy. For others, it may take a little longer. If you are looking to conceive and wondering about the best positions to get pregnant, you have come to the right place.
      </p>

      <p>According to the experts, different sex positions doesn’t make much difference when you’re trying to conceive. Still, there are always theories and ideas behind why certain sex positions could be best for your baby making – they generally involve the idea of encouraging gravity to help his sperm along.
      If both partners are fertile, and the timing is right, any sexual position can result in pregnancy. "Sperm are resilient and are able to swim upstream for quite a distance. Not only that, but they last for several days in a female body.
      The timing of intercourse is the most important issue. However, to maximise the chance of pregnancy, it’s worth giving some thought to your position during sex, as it can alter the depth of penetration and the likelihood of conception"
      In any case, there is no harm in trying! So, here are some of the best sex positions that will bring on that positive pregnancy test and also make the process much more fun
      </p>

      <ul>

      <li><h4>Missionary Position:</h4></li>
      <p>Let’s just say this – most babies, from around the world, come into being with this position!
      The most common and the most popular sex position, the missionary is also the most comfortable position to make a baby.
      With your partner on top and you lying on your back, the sperms get the best possible path to the cervix and help you conceive.</p>

      <li><h4>Glowing Triangle</h4></li>
      <p>Don’t let the name give you ideas! The glowing triangle is just a twist on the ever-popular missionary position. Just like the missionary, in the glowing triangle you are on your back with your partner on top. The only difference is that in this particular position, the man is on all fours with his legs extended out. With your pelvis slightly raised, you can easily wrap your legs around your partner.</p>

      <li><h4>Doggy Style:</h4></li>
      <p>We are sure your partner will agree that the doggy style is all over great! But what they may not know is that it is also an excellent way to conceive a baby, quickly.
      This particular pregnancy positions helps in deeper penetration. It also opens up the cervix more than other positions, making it easier for the sperms to make their way inside. It is one of the best position to get pregnant.</p>

      <li><h4>Spooning:</h4></li>
      <p>Spooning is not just great for making a baby but is also a very romantic way to end things!
      In this pose, you lie on your side, with your partner spooning you from behind. The position ensures that your pelvis is tilted at a 90-degree angle, providing better reach for your partner’s sperms.</p>

      <li><h4>Butterfly: </h4></li>
      <p> With a name as pretty as the butterfly, you’ll expect a romantic sex position, right? Well, this is not soft and romantic! It is adventurous, perfect way to spice up your baby making adventures.
      You’ll need to lie on your back, on a table. Yes, you’ll need a table for this particular position. Next, your partner will need to move between your feet and lift your hips (or you can put pillows under your hips)
      The butterfly is the best position to fall pregnant and also add some excitement to your sex life. It also helps the sperms stay in the vagina longer, ensuring better chances of conceiving.</p>

      <li><h4>Magic Mountain:</h4></li>
      <p>Another variance of the doggy style pose, the magic mountain is the best position to get pregnant fast.
      Unlike the doggy pose, here your partner bends over you in such a way that your back is against his chest. You can even use pillows under your head for better balance.
      The magic mountain position is perfect for baby making as it allows the sperm to move deeper, faster. It also hits the G-spot and helps you orgasm</p>

      <li><h4>Plough:</h4></li>
      <p> Now this pose is not for the faint hearted! If you are physically fit and looking to spice up your sex life while trying to conceive, you can try the plough!
      In this position, you’ll be a wheel burrow! You’ll need to stand on your feet, with your legs in the air. Don’t worry! Your partner will hold onto your legs as he penetrates.
      What makes this a great making pose is that you’ll allow gravity do its work and pull the sperms further down the cervix.</p>

      <li><h4>The Sphinx:</h4></li>
      <p>In this pose, you’ll have to lie on your tummy, with your weight on your forearms. One of your legs should be bent to the side while the other should be straight behind you. Your partner will then straddle you, with his weight on his arms.
      The Sphinx is a good position and allows deeper penetration and faster conception.</p>

      </ul>


      <h3> When is the best time to have sex if I'm trying to conceive?</h3>
      <p>This is a very important one and all depends on when you are ovulating - if you're not sure, use our ovulation calculatorto find out exactly when this window is. For most women, having sex around 14 days after your last period is when you are at your most fertile. Although there is a window of important days, try and have sex regularly throughout the month, as this is thought to be more effective than just having sex for one week a month.</p>


      <h3>Do I need to orgasm when trying to conceive?</h3>
      <p>Obviously, it's very important that your partner orgasms in trying to conceive sex, but there is no evidence that female orgasms make any difference here. Gentle contractions in your womb can help to move the sperm along, up into the cervix, but these happen with or without you having an orgasm.</p>

      <h3>Are there sex positions that mean I'm more likely to have a boy or a girl? </h3>
      <p>There's no research that says different positions mean you're more likely to conceive a boy or a girl, but there are plenty of old wive's tales that suggest differently. One claims that to conceive a girl, you should have plenty of sex with you on top. Another claims if you have plenty of sex with him on top, you are more likely to conceive a boy. </p>


      <h3>Things To Avoid If You Are Trying To Conceive:</h3>
      <p>Enough of the indulgence, now for some bad news! You’ll have to make some changes in your lifestyle if you want to conceive easily. Here are a few things you may have to give up:</p>

      <ol>
          <li><b>Smoking:</b></li>
          <p>Smoking is not good for you, but if you still like a puff or two every day, it is time to stop. According to experts, smokers are more likely to suffer from infertility and have difficulty while conceiving than those who don’t smoke. In fact, women who smoke are more likely to produce eggs with genetic abnormalities. Not just you, even your partner should quit smoking now because men who smoke are more likely to have lower sperm count.</p>

          <li><b>Excessive Caffeine:</b></li>
          <p>The good news is that you don’t have to banish caffeine entirely from your life. But the bad news is that you have to cut drastically down the amount you consume. All that extra caffeine in your system can throw your reproductive health out of gear and make conceiving difficult.</p>

          <li><b>Too Much Alcohol:</b></li>
          <p>Too much of a good thing can be bad too, and it is true with alcohol! A glass of bubbly here and there will do you no harm, but do not drink more than two drinks a day if you want to conceive without too many difficulties. Too much alcohol in the system can cause irregular periods, lack of ovulation, and abnormal estrogen and progesterone levels – all factors that can make conceiving difficult.
          As you can see, there is not much you have to forgo to make a baby!</p>
   </ol>

   <h3>When To Seek Help: </h3>
   <p>Unfortunately, no matter what you do, there is a small chance that you’ll have trouble conceiving. So, when is the right time to seek medical help to make a baby?</p>
   <ul>
      <li>If you are over 35 and have not conceived even after six months of unprotected sex, go to a doctor.</li>
      <li>If you are younger than 35 and a year of unprotected sex has not yet yielded a positive pregnancy test, you can go for a doctor’s appointment.</li>
      <li>But there are reasons why you should see your doctor even before you start trying to conceive.</li>

  </ul>


    <p>The one thing you need to keep in mind when you are trying to conceive is to give it time. Some couples conceive in the first try while others can take months or even years. So keep it fun and seek help if you need.
    But do not allow the journey to ruin your marriage and sex life. The positions we have listed here are not just great to make a baby but will also keep the fires of your passion burning!<br/>
    Best of luck!
    </p>
